### trubetskoy_colors.R
quick R function implementing Sasga Trubetskoy's [list of 20 simple, distinct colors](https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/). which are in turn inspired by Kelly's 22 colors of maximum contrast.

### drawafit.R
quick function to draw a linear fit on a graph using `curve` and not going out of bounds.

### lmm_example.R
a trivial example of how to run a lmm using `lme4::lmer`

### logisticglmm_Example.r
a trivial example of how to run a glmm (logistic) using `lme4::glmer`

### logit_speed_test.R
I was curious if the different ways of implementing logit and invlogit made a difference for speed in R. looks like `exp` is expensive.

### recursive_copy.sh
I can never remember the syntax. also this works on macos.
